Welcome to the Music Platform Backend project! This application is a Java Spring Boot backend for a simple music platform. It provides essential functionalities for managing music tracks and user authentication.

**This project was implemented as part of the SHIFT Intensive organized by [CFT Team](https://team.cft.ru/).**


## Technologies Used

- Java Spring Boot: Web framework for building Java applications.
- Cassandra: NoSQL database for handling data.
- Spring Security: Authentication and access control for Spring applications.
- Spring Actuator: Monitor and manage application health and metrics.
- JUnit 5: Testing framework for Java applications.
- Docker: Containerization platform for easy deployment.
- OpenAPI: Specification for documenting and interacting with RESTful APIs.
